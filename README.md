BAND NAME GENETATOR

This is a simple program that, takes one of the simplest data types in python, which are strings to produce a program that generates a name.
The idea behind the specific code written, Is that, it will take the name of the city you grew up in, and your pet name, combine the two then give you a name that you can use.
In order to get the two names as one we have to combine them when getting the output. One of the easiest ways to combine strings in python is using the + symbol. It will combine two strings then output them as one. Space is added to the strings by adding an empty string in the form of quotation marks onto the final print statement. The empty string will function as a way to add space in between the two strings. 
This has been a simple python project that introduces strings and string concatenation.
